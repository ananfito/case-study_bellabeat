# Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

This project is the capstone assignment for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program. The program prepares participants for a career in data analytics with training focused on key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, and visualization) and tools (Excel, SQL, R Programming, Tableau).

We'll be investigating data sets of FitBit usage to make high-level marketing recommendations for Bellabeat---a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.
